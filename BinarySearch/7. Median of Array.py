# There are two sorted arrays A and B of sizes N and M respectively.

# Find the median of the two sorted arrays ( The median of the array formed by merging both the arrays ).

# NOTE:

# The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m+n)).
# IF the number of elements in the merged array is even, then the median is the average of (n/2)th and (n/2+1)th element. 
# For example, if the array is [1 2 3 4], the median is (2 + 3) / 2.0 = 2.5.
