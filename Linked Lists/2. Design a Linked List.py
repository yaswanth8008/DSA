# Design and implement a Linked List data structure.
# A node in a linked list should have the following attributes - an integer value and a pointer to the next node.

# It should support the following operations:

# insert_node(position, value) - To insert the input value at the given position in the linked list.
# delete_node(position) - Delete the value at the given position from the linked list.
# print_ll() - Print the entire linked list, such that each element is followed by a single space (no trailing spaces).
